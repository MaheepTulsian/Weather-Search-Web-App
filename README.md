# Weather Search Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather for a specific location. Users can either select a major city from a dropdown list or enter a custom location in a text input field. Upon clicking the "Search" button, the application retrieves and displays weather information for the chosen location.

## Features

- **Dropdown City Selection**: Users can choose from a list of major cities in a dropdown menu. This makes it quick and easy to select a city without typing.

- **Custom Location Input**: For users interested in weather information for a specific location not in the dropdown, a text input field is provided to enter a custom location.

- **Weather Data Display**: The application displays weather information, including the temperature in degrees Celsius and an icon representing the current weather conditions.

- **Responsive Design**: The web application has a responsive design, making it suitable for use on various devices, including desktop and mobile.

- **Error Handling**: The application handles potential errors gracefully. If there's an issue with the location data or if the weather data is unavailable, users will receive an error message.

## Usage

1. **Select a City**: Choose a major city from the dropdown list. The text input field will be automatically filled with the selected city name.

2. **Custom Location (Optional)**: If you want to check the weather for a location not in the dropdown, you can manually enter the location in the text input field.

3. **Retrieve Weather**: Click the "Search" button or Press "ENTER" to fetch the weather information for the selected city or custom location.

4. **View Weather Data**: The weather data, including the temperature and weather conditions, will be displayed in the main section of the page.
